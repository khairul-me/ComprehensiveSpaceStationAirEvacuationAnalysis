This complete analysis demonstrates the complex interplay of various physical phenomena in space station depressurization, from fundamental molecular physics to practical engineering considerations.

The analysis reveals that while the basic process can be modeled using ideal gas assumptions, the complete physical picture involves multiple interacting phenomena that affect the final evacuation time and station conditions.
