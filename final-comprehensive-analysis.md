# Critical Additional Considerations

## 21. Microgravity Effects

### 21.1 Flow Pattern Modification
* Absence of natural convection
* Modified bubble formation
* Altered phase separation
* Different mixing patterns
```
Fr = v²/gL → ∞ (microgravity)
Bo = ρgL²/σ → 0
```

### 21.2 Surface Tension Dominated Phenomena
* Marangoni effects
* Capillary flow modifications
* Interface stability
* Droplet behavior

## 22. Time-Scale Analysis

### 22.1 Characteristic Times
```
t_sonic = L/a ≈ 0.15s (acoustic time)
t_thermal = L²/α ≈ 3600s (thermal diffusion)
t_viscous = L²/ν ≈ 2500s (viscous diffusion)
t_molecular = λ/v_thermal ≈ 10⁻¹⁰s (molecular collision)
```

### 22.2 Process Coupling
* Fast processes (molecular collisions)
* Intermediate processes (flow establishment)
* Slow processes (thermal equilibration)
